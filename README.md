# Stack_Operations
# Stack Operating System - README

## Project Overview
The Stack Operating System is a Java-based application designed to demonstrate and utilize the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle of stack data structures. It provides an intuitive interface for performing standard stack operations and expression conversions, along with user authentication and operation history tracking.

## Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system
- **Stack Operations**: 
  - Push, Pop, Peek
  - Check Size, Clear Stack, Check if Empty
- **Expression Conversions**:
  - Infix to Prefix/Postfix
  - Prefix to Infix/Postfix
  - Postfix to Prefix/Infix
- **Operation History**: Tracks all stack operations with timestamps
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage of user data and operations

## Technical Implementation
- **Data Structures**:
  - Java's built-in Stack class
  - Custom User and StackOperation classes
- **Database**:
  - MySQL for data persistence
  - Users and Stack_operations tables
- **Technologies**:
  - Java (Collections Framework, Exception Handling, OOP)
  - XAMPP for database management
  - Visual Studio Code as IDE

## System Architecture
- **ER Diagram**: Shows relationship between Users and Stack_operations
- **Flow Chart**: Illustrates user workflow from login to operations
- **Use Case Diagram**: Demonstrates all system functionalities

## Getting Started
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Java Runtime Environment
   - XAMPP (for MySQL database)
   - Visual Studio Code (recommended)

2. **Setup**:
   - Import the project into your Java IDE
   - Configure database connection in XAMPP
   - Run the application

## Merits
✔ User authentication system  
✔ Comprehensive stack operations  
✔ Multiple expression conversion options  
✔ Robust error handling  
✔ Object-oriented design principles  

## Future Enhancements
- Implement data encryption for security
- Add multi-user collaboration features
- Develop mobile and web interfaces
- Expand to support more data structures
- Optimize code for better performance
